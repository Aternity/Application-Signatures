It's a Recorder/WAC hybrid, triggering WebEx joins from current supported browsers IE/FF/Chrome, and also the 'Cisco WebEx Meetings' tool for those that have it, and also the 'Meet Now' button in Outlook if you have this. The customer wanted me to cover all basis so I have thought of every way of joining a WebEx and just completed a successful client-side validation on my PC of all of these scenarios. I didn't have any failures or crashes during Recording, so there are currently no Unavailable conditions in the signature sadly, but I am keen to get them added in if anyone would like to share their Unavailable conditions. This signature will 'Complete' at the select Audio Screen and/or 'thanks for joining, please wait for the host to also join etc'. Any questions, just let me know! Cheers all. Steve Sussich.
