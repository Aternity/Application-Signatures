In this repo, you will be able to find examples of Application signatures shared by the Aternity Community

- Signature files are grouped into folders by application (and maybe a version)
- Each folder has a REAME.md file that will describe:
  - All activities that are part of this monitoring package
  - Specify what it measures for each activity

**Note:** These signatures havenâ€™t not been QA-ed by Aternity Engineering, please test locally before deployed in production
